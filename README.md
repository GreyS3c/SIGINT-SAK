# SIGINT-SAK
A “Swiss Army Knife”  signals intelligence (SIGINT) toolkit for the novice Linux operator.

**Description:**
The SIGINT-SAK Project was built to provide a light weight, comprehensive toolkit for the amateur signals intelligence researcher who has little to no Linux experience, and on a budget of less than $300 USD (January 2023); though expanded equipment components (such as the HackRF modules or larger capacity batteries) could bring the total cost to just shy of $500 USD. 
This project seeks to aggregate the most capable open-source projects in the SIGINT community, and automate use of common CLI commands through Zenity for quick use on small touch screens. In its most comprehensive use cases, SIGINT-SAK integrates advanced WiFi & Bluetooth tools, software-defined radio and traditional GPS (via gpsd – if desired)....
Written entirely in bash for simple modification by the end user, the project was designed with the following capabilities in mind: 
- Automated installation & configuration best practices
- GUI menus & buttons to automate common commands and scan types, built with Zenity
- Various HF, VHF and UHF scanning, RX and TX capabilities
- WiFi & Bluetooth scans & direction finding common to passive network and device reconnaissance (including retail drone direction finding).
- Wireless & mobile device identification. 
- Metadata examination & removal for anonymous file sharing
- File encryption
